## Summary

PMLB (Penn Machine Learning Benchmark) is an open source data repository containing a curated collection of datasets for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) algorithms.
Compiled from a broad range of existing ML benchmark collections, PMLB unifies over 150 publicly available datasets from diverse sources such as Kaggle and OpenML, enabling systematic assessment of different ML methods.
These datasets cover a range of applications, from binary/multi-class classification to regression problems with combinations of categorical and continuous features.
PMLB has both a Python interface (`pmlb`) and an R interface (`pmlbr`), both with detailed documentation that allow the user to access datasets using a simple `fetch_data` function. PMLB also offers detailed analyses of each dataset with pandas profiling, and advanced methods, such as `near_datasets` and `filter_datasets`, which allow for smoother user experience and handling of data.
