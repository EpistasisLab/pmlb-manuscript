## Summary

PMLB (Penn Machine Learning Benchmark) is an open source repository containing a curated collection of datasets for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) algorithms.
Compiled from a broad range of existing ML benchmark collection, PMLB unified over 150 publicly available datasets from large repositories such as Kaggle and OpenML, enabling systematic assessment of different ML methods.
These datasets cover a range of applications, from binary/multi-class classification to regression problems with combinations of categorical and continuous features.
PMLB have an R interface (pmlbr) and a Python interface (pmlb) with detailed documentation that allow the user to access the datasets with a simple `fetch_data` function.
